    bio: 'My name is Lea, I was born in 1991. I\'m from a small town in Hungary and currently living in Scotland. Iâ€™ve always loved to draw which I had the opportunity to develop at an Art oriented High school. Since the High School years, I develop myself in a self-taught way. I love to work with pen and ink and I try to reflect this in my digital arts too. My graphics\' atmosphere is mainly dark art which is interspersed with Art Nouveau and surreal elements. I like to draw illustrations, apparel graphics, album covers and tattoo designs. I get most of my inspiration from nature, but often a book, song, movie, poem or other artists, mainly the past\'s masters\' work motivates me.\n My goal is to create a unique atmosphere spiced up with some symbolism.'
